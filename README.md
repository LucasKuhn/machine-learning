# machine-learning

A computer program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T, and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E. 

## Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.  
  
Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.  
  
### Regression

Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

### Classification

Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the effect of the variables.  

### Clustering: 
Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.  

### Non-clustering: 
The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds)  

## Model Representation
To describe the supervised learning problem slightly more formally, our goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X → Y so that h(x) is a “good” predictor for the corresponding value of y.

When the target variable that we’re trying to predict is continuous, such as in our housing example, we call the learning problem a regression problem. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem.  

### Cost Function

We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function. This takes an average difference (actually a fancier version of an average) of all the results of the hypothesis with inputs from x's and the actual output y's.  

This function is otherwise called the "Squared error function", or "Mean squared error". The mean is halved as a convenience for the computation of the gradient descent, as the derivative term of the square function will cancel out the 1/2 term. The following image summarizes what the cost function does:

## Intuition I
If we try to think of it in visual terms, our training data set is scattered on the x-y plane. We are trying to make a straight line which passes through these scattered data points.  

Our objective is to get the best possible line. The best possible line will be such so that the average squared vertical distances of the scattered points from the line will be the least. Ideally, the line should pass through all the points of our training data set.

# Parameter Learning

## Gradient Descent

Imagine that we graph our hypothesis function based on its fields (actually we are graphing the cost function as a function of the parameter estimates). We are not graphing x and y itself, but the parameter range of our hypothesis function and the cost resulting from selecting a particular set of parameters.  

![image](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bn9SyaDIEeav5QpTGIv-Pg_0d06dca3d225f3de8b5a4a7e92254153_Screenshot-2016-11-01-23.48.26.png?expiry=1528761600000&hmac=kYDAceoIeN1vPAHtl2nucOnPZL9uda6Lpd5sDAlzVqQ) 

We will know that we have succeeded when our cost function is at the very bottom of the pits in our graph, i.e. when its value is the minimum. The red arrows show the minimum points in the graph.  

At each iteration j, one should simultaneously update the parameters. Updating a specific parameter prior to calculating another one on the (n)th iteration would yield to a wrong implementation.
